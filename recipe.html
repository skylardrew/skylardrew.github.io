    <p><i>Editor's Note: These Honey Candy Apples are a healthier take on the caramel apple trend! The candy coating is
            made from
            all-natural honey and sugar for a sweet treat that's also fun to make. The kids will love helping you dip
            the
            apples into the candy coating. This makes for a fun project for the whole family! Bonus points if the apples
            are
            fresh-picked, but store-bought is fine if you're short on orchards in your area. Thanksgiving can be even
            sweeter this year with these candy apples. Enjoy this classic fall treat guilt-free!</i></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>- 6 red delicious apples</ul>
    <ul>- 2 1/2 cups sugar</ul>
    <ul>- 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons water</ul>
    <ul>- 2 tablespoons honey</ul>
    <ul>- 2 tablespoons corn syrup or glucose</ul>
    <ul>- Few drops lemon juice, optional</ul>
    <ul>- 1/2 teaspoon red gel-based food coloring, optional</ul>
    <ul>- Few drops rosewater extract, optional</ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>1. Remove any stickers from the apples, and then wash and dry them thoroughly. Insert a licorice stick or wooden
        skewer in the top of each apple, pushing it down until it is securely in the fruit. Line a baking sheet with
        parchment paper.</ol>
    <ol>2. In a heavy-based saucepan, combine the sugar, water, honey, corn syrup, lemon juice, food coloring and
        rosewater
        extract. Heat over medium-high heat, gently stirring until the sugar melts and the mixture comes to a boil. Once
        the mixture boils, attach a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan and continue heating, now without
        stirring, until it reaches 305◦F. Brush down the sides of the saucepan with a pastry brush dipped in water to
        prevent sugar crystals from forming. Swirl the saucepan from time to time so the caramel cooks evenly.</ol>
    <ol>3. Remove saucepan from the heat and let the liquid sit until the bubbles subside.</ol>
    <ol>4. Dip each fruit into the syrup and then place on the baking sheet. Cool to room temperature and store in a dry
        place until ready to serve. Serve on same day. If you’re giving the candy apples as gifts, wrap them in
        decorative cellophane.</ol>
