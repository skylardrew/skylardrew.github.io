    <p><span>Hello Kitty</span> (Japanese: ハロー・キティ, Hepburn: Harō Kiti), also known by her real name <span>Kitty
            White</span> (キティ・ホワイト, Kiti
        Howaito), is a fictional character created by Yuko Shimizu, currently designed by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuko_Shimizu">Yuko Yamaguchi</a>, and owned by
        the Japanese company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanrio">Sanrio</a>. Sanrio depicts Hello Kitty as an
        anthropomorphized white cat with a red bow and no
        visible mouth. According to her backstory, she lives in a London suburb with her family, and is close to her
        twin sister Mimmy, who is depicted with a yellow bow.</p>
    <p>Hello Kitty was created in 1974 and the first item, a vinyl coin purse, was introduced in 1975. Originally Hello
        Kitty was only marketed towards pre-teenage girls, but beginning in the 1990s, the brand found commercial
        success among teenage and adult consumers as well. Hello Kitty's popularity also grew with the emergence of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii">kawaii</a> (cute) culture. The brand went into decline in Japan
        after the 1990s, but continued to grow in the
        international market. By 2010 the character was worth $5 billion a year and The New York Times called her a
        "global marketing phenomenon". By 2014, when Hello Kitty was 40 years old, she was worth about $8 billion a
        year.
    </p>
    <p>UNICEF has appointed Hello Kitty children's ambassador and the Japanese government appointed her ambassador of
        tourism. There are Sanrio theme parks based on Hello Kitty: Harmonyland in Hiji, Ōita, Japan, Sanrio Puroland in
        Tama New Town, Tokyo, Japan, and Hello Kitty Shanghai Times in Shanghai, China. The Hello Kitty media franchise
        has grown to include a number of animated series targeted towards children, as well as several manga comics,
        anime films, video games, books, music albums and other media productions. A variety of products have featured
        the character over the years, like school supplies, clothing, accessories and toys, along with other items. As
        of 2008 there were over 50,000 different Hello Kitty branded products.</p>

        <figcaption>Yuko Shimizu, the original designer of Hello Kitty.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In 1962, Shintaro Tsuji, founder of Sanrio, began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them. Tsuji
        noted the profits gained by adding a cute design to the shoes and hired cartoonists to design cute characters
        for his merchandise. Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added to the lineup of early Sanrio
        characters in 1974.</p>
    <p>Hello Kitty was initially known only as "the white kitten with no name" (名前のない白い子猫). Shimizu got the name Kitty
        from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass; during a scene early in the book, Alice plays with a cat she
        calls Kitty. Sanrio's motto is "social communication," and Tsuji wanted the brand name to reflect that by
        including a greeting. He first considered "Hi Kitty" before finally settling on "Hello Kitty," her current name.
        Sanrio decided to make Hello Kitty British because foreign countries, in particular Britain, were trendy in
        Japan at the time of Hello Kitty's creation. Sanrio already had several characters set in the US, and it wanted
        Hello Kitty to be different.</p>
    <p>In 1976 Setsuko Yonekubo temporarily took over as lead designer for Hello Kitty, after Shimizu left Sanrio. In
        1980 Yuko Yamaguchi became lead designer and has remained in charge since. Yamaguchi has said that fashion,
        movies, and TV inspire her in creating new designs. New series involving Hello Kitty with different themed
        designs are released regularly, following current trends.</p>

        <figcaption>Hello Kitty's first appearance on Japanese merchandise (March 1975).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The character's first appearance on an item was in March 1975 on a vinyl coin purse sold in Japan, where she was
        pictured sitting between a bottle of milk and a goldfish bowl. She first appeared in the United States in 1976
        when Sanrio opened a Gift Gate store in San Jose, California.</p>
    <p>Hello Kitty sold well immediately after her 1975 launch, and Sanrio's sales increased sevenfold. Due to Japan's
        growing economy, many Japanese children could afford to buy Hello Kitty products. Her popularity also grew with
        the emergence of kawaii culture, which embraces cuteness.</p>
    <p>UNICEF named Hello Kitty as children's ambassador to the United States in 1983, children's ambassador in Japan in
        1994, and gave her the title of UNICEF Special Friend of Children in 2004, a title unique to her.</p>
    <p>Originally, Hello Kitty was only marketed towards a child and preteen audience. In the 1990s, the target market
        for Hello Kitty was broadened to include teenagers and adults as a retro brand. Marketing to those who could not
        get Hello Kitty merchandise as children, and those who fondly remember items they had, Sanrio began selling
        Hello Kitty branded products such as purses and laptops. The 1994 to 1996 Face series was the first to be
        designed specifically for mature consumers.</p>
    <p>Hello Kitty's popularity in Japan peaked in the late 1990s when she was the country's top-grossing character. In
        2002, Hello Kitty lost her place as the top-grossing character in Japan in the Character Databank popularity
        chart. In a 2010 survey, she was in third place behind Anpanman and Pikachu from Pokémon. In 2010, The New York
        Times attributed the character's relative decline in Japan to her biography not being "compelling enough to draw
        many fans." The newspaper later wrote that analysts called the characterization "weak," and that Hello Kitty not
        having a mouth has dampened her success as an animated TV character. According to Character Databank, Hello
        Kitty was the third highest-grossing character in Japan as of 2013. In 2019 and 2020, Character Databank ranked
        her fifth, and as of 2021 she was out of the top five.</p>
    <h4>Character</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello Kitty is a gijinka, an anthropomorphism or personification of a Japanese Bobtail cat. Official character
        profiles list her full name as Kitty White (キティ・ホワイト, Kiti Howaito), born in the suburbs of London, England, on
        November 1. Her height is described as five apples and her weight as three apples. She is portrayed as a bright
        and kind-hearted girl, very close to her twin sister Mimmy. She is good at baking cookies and loves her mama's
        homemade apple pie. She likes to play the piano and collect cute things, and her favorite subjects in school are
        English, music, and art.</p>
    <p>Hello Kitty is portrayed with a large family with the surname White. Her twin sister Mimmy is described as "shy
        and very girly," interested in sewing and dreaming of marriage. While Hello Kitty wears a red bow on her left
        ear, Mimmy wears a yellow one on her right. Their papa George is described as dependable, humorous but also
        absent-minded. Their mama Mary is portrayed as a good cook who loves doing housework. Grandpa Anthony likes to
        tell stories and grandma Margaret likes sewing. In addition to family, Hello Kitty is also depicted with several
        animal friends, including the mice Joey and Judy, the bears Tippy and Thomas, the raccoon Tracy and the squirrel
        Rorry.</p>
    <p>Aside from the core Hello Kitty characters, several spinoff characters have been created: Hello Kitty's boyfriend
        Dear Daniel in 1999, Charmmy Kitty, Hello Kitty's pet cat, and Sugar, her pet hamster, both in 2004, and her
        superhero alter-ego Ichigoman in 2011.</p>
    <h5>Media</h5>
    <hr>
    <h6>Animated series</h6>
    <p>There have been several different animated series starring Hello Kitty. The first was Hello Kitty's Furry Tale
        Theater, an animated television series with 13 22-minute episodes that premiered in 1987. The next, an OVA
        titled Hello Kitty and Friends, spanned 30 entries originally released in Japan between 1989 and 1994. Hello
        Kitty's Paradise came out in 1999 and was 16 episodes long. Hello Kitty's Stump Village came out in 2005, and
        The Adventures of Hello Kitty & Friends came out in 2008 and has aired 52 episodes. A crossover series under the
        name Kiss Hello Kitty (that paired animated versions of the members of the rock band KISS with Hello Kitty) was
        announced in March 2013. Produced by Gene Simmons, this show was supposed to air on The Hub Network (now
        Discovery Family), but it never came to fruition.</p>
    <p>Hello Kitty's Paradise was a long-running live-action children's program that aired on TXN from January 1999 to
        March 2011. It was the longest-running weekly kids' television program in the network's history. In January
        2011, the show's creators mutually agreed to end the series after twelve seasons, with the final episode being
        broadcast on 29 March 2011.</p>
    <h7>Comics</h7>
    <p>Hello Kitty had two manga comics serialized in Ribon, a shōjo manga magazine - Hello Kitty Doki (ran from May
        2007 to April 2008) and Hello Kitty Peace (released in June 2008).</p>
    <p>In March 2016, Sanrio launched a webcomic featuring Hello Kitty as a strawberry-themed superhero called Ichigoman
        (ichigo meaning strawberry). The webcomic is created by Toshiki Inoue and Shakua Sinkai and updates once a
        month. Ichigoman first appeared in 2011 in an exhibition with Yuko Yamaguchi's art.</p>
    <h8>Video games</h8>
    <p>There are numerous Hello Kitty games starting with the release of the first title for Famicom in 1992; however,
        the majority of these games were never released outside of Japan. Hello Kitty also has made cameo appearances in
        games featuring other Sanrio characters, such as the Keroppi game, Kero Kero Keroppi no Bōken Nikki: Nemureru
        Mori no Keroleen. Special-edition consoles such as the Hello Kitty Dreamcast, Hello Kitty Game Boy Pocket, and
        Hello Kitty Crystal Xbox have also been released exclusively in Japan.</p>
    <p>Hello Kitty appeared as a guest character in Sega's Sonic Dash in 2016, as part of Sega's partnership with
        Sanrio. Hello Kitty and My Melody (another Sanrio character) appeared together in Super Mario Maker as
        unlockable Mystery Mushroom costumes. Hello Kitty appears as a playable character via downloadable content in
        Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania.</p>
